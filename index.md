Welcome. Make yourself at home. Put your paws/tail up and relax a little. This is a safe little space for
critters and creatures from all around the world. Lay under a fan or your favourite heat lamp, and enjoy.

## What is this website?

**alterhuman.org.uk** is a resource for those who identify as alterhuman, therian, otherkin, or otherwise as partially/fully non-human. We offer a safe space and repository of information for those who are curious, already accept their identity, or would like to know more and educate themselves.

The information on this website is published under the **MIT Licence**, meaning it can be freely copied, shared, and distributed with or without attribution (although attribution is nice :D).

## What's on here?

We aim to provide an up to date list of resources, from literature, history, to mental health resources. We also run game servers, and maintain a group chat for people to meet and socialize.

**We are not a support network**, but we hope the information and links on this website help you on your journey of self-exploration. :)
