## About

**alterhuman.org.uk** is a free, public-domain (MIT Licence) resource and repository of information pertaining to the alterhuman/therian/otherkin experience, as well as to foster a small and inclusive community of likeminded people.

This website was started in July 2025 due to the apparent non-existence of an already existing UK alterhuman community, before a few furry and convention-centric chats.

If you have any questions or would like to contact us for any reason, we can be reached at [admin@alterhuman.org.uk](mailto:admin@alterhuman.org.uk).
