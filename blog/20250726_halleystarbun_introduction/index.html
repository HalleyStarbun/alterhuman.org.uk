    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <i>Halley Starbun - 26th July 2025</i>

    <p>Hello! My name is Halley, and welcome to alterhuman.org.uk. I‚Äôm not great at writing stuff, but I‚Äôll try and give a little background information about myself, the stuff I do, and why I started this website.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôve been a therian since.. probably about eleven or twelve years old? The first vivid memories I have are staying up late and sitting with my laptop on the windowsill, my windows wide open and the cool night breeze washing over my skin. It felt euphoric, and in the darkness my brain conjured images of a deep, dark forest. Somewhere safe, somewhere cosy, somewhere far away from here. I don‚Äôt want to delve too deeply into my home life, but needless to say, those calm nights were a huge relief in what was otherwise a very stressful and intense time in my life. The feeling gradually faded however; due to a mix of growing responsibilities and PTSD, I pushed down a lot of my more vulnerable and honest thoughts, and focused merely on survival. Kind of like a wild animal.</p>
    <p>I think it was years later when I started actually meeting other therians/alterhumans that I began to slowly rediscover my identity. I was rediscovering much of myself around this time, in terms of gender, identity, and self. It was (and continues to be) a learning experience, figuring oneself out does not simply happen overnight. It takes years of processing, learning, poking in uncomfortable places to find truths. Having a good community helps however. It was around 2023 I started meeting folk and became aware of the various online communities, and finally found a name that felt right for me: therian.</p>
    <p>Community is important, for many reasons, so I was surprised to learn that no one I talked with was aware of an existing wider alterhuman community within the United Kingdom. Now, I‚Äôve never ran a community before, not beyond my own personal Discord server and a Mastodon instance which sadly closed recently, but I thought ‚ÄúWell, someone has to make the first step, it might as well be me‚Äù. I‚Äôm not doing this for personal gain, or profit, or any other reason. I just know how to cobble together a website, and maintain a group chat. This project may take off, it may also not. It may be a slow burner. Either way, I hope this website and the community I hope to form offers some useful advice, and a sense of belonging, in an increasingly fragmented and divided world.</p>
    <p>I promise to keep this a safe space for all, regardless of gender, species, race, sexuality, or identity. While of course I plan for this to be a place for UK alterhumans to gather, the information here should be broadly useful regardless of country or state. The information hosted under this domain is MIT Licenced, meaning it may be copied freely and shared, with or without attribution, although credit is certainly appreciated. :)</p>
    <p>And remember. You are valid. You are important. You are loved.</p>
    <p>I promise. üíô</p>
