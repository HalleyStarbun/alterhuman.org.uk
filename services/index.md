## Services

### Minecraft Server

We run a small vanilla Minecraft server for people to play on, contact @HalleyStarbun on Telegram to be added to the whitelist. :)

### Future Services

In future we'd like to offer a Tilde-like service, offering light web hosting and server space for tinkerers and programmers to use. This requires considerable setup however, and is currently just a concept.
